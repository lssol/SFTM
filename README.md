The initial POC typescript implementation of the [SFTM  tree matching algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12821) I wrote for my PhD.

This code was mostly used to allow quick experimentation.

If you want to use SFTM you should rather use the [Kotlin implementation](https://github.com/lssol/sftm_tree_matching) that is published in the [official MAVEN repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.amaris/sftm-tree-matching) or the [C# implementation](https://github.com/lssol/sftm-csharp).
